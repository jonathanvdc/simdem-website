Hello and welcome to the first article in the new Simpolitics section of this website. These articles will always work to bring you the latest in regards to Politics and Political Scandals.

I have interviewed 4 people in regards to this situation. Jont, Our President. JacobInAustin, Our Chief of Staff. Benitfeet, The Discord Supervisor and Halfcat, our victim. All interviewees have given me permission to share anything that we talked about.

## Is the President to blame?

Well from what I have gathered, No. Everybody I have asked has said they fully trust Jont.

To quote Benits response to my question "Would this affect your opinion of Jont in any way? Do you believe she made a mistake hiring them? If Jont approves of Jacob will you gain the same opinion of Jont as you currently have of Jacob?"

"Not at all, I trust Jont. I wouldn't say mistake, but it is a learning opportunity for us all. No, this doesn't change my opinion of Jont" -Benit

It seems that in this situation most people believe that Jacob acted without the consent of the President and that while hiring Jacob was not a mistake it would not be great to hire someone like them again. To quote Halfcat "This is Jont's Presidency, not their chief of staffs."

The general consensus seems to be that Jacob is doing to much for the President and that Jacob should stop "abusing" there power. Of course Jont tells a different story.

Jont does not believe that Jacob did anything very wrong. To quote her "I think Jacob acted rashly", She also said "At the moment I'll keep them in their current position, I still feel it has potential." and "Jacob is really a nice fella, I do understand why people are not necessarily happy with them right now, but I think they genuinely are a nice person and doing their best."

So it seems Jacob did not seek Presidential approval and as such the President should not be blamed but now that they have come out in support of Jacob, if they were to do anything again in the future should she be blamed? It is certainly something to keep in mind as I am sure we will all be carefully watching Jacobs career in the future.

## What do both sides think what they do?

Well as you may expect many seem split by the issue. With the 4 people I interviewed generally taking quite different stances. Jacob believes that they were mostly in the right, President Jont believes that Jacob acted rashly but should not be fired, Benit believes that Jacob was absolutely in the wrong but would trust Jont if she decided not to fire Jacob and Half is completely against Jacob and believes that they are absolutely in the wrong.

I asked people why they thought what they did.

Benit said in response to me asking should they get another chance. " Normally, I would say give another chance as he's new. However, prior to the incident he released a memo that stated that he would be authoritarian, this is what fundamentally caused the fallout. Authoritarianism holds no place in SimDemocracy. He should be given the chance to graciously resign"

However in response if he would trust Jont if she decided not to fire Jacob he said "I would trust her". He also said that appointing Jacob and then this happening may have been a "learning oppurtunity"

Well Half sent quite a similar message. In response to me asking "do you believe Jacobs ideas are good and if not will you resign?" he said "I obviously wouldn't have resigned. This is Jont's Presidency, not their chief of staffs. So far all they've done is act like they're worth more than everyone else, so not really something I agree with. Mostly they seem to have the wrong idea about SimDemocracy, we're a community where the President is just another person, they're not put on a pedestal above everyone else and inaccesible to us "commoners""

In response to me asking if they could work together in the future if this is sorted out he said "Maybe, who knows. For now though I don't think they should be Chief of Staff, or have any power really since they seem prone to "abuse" it."

Now Jacob themselves. I of course asked for some background into this situation and this is the response I received "Mr. Halfcat was acting very, very unprofessional and we're, generally speaking, very much hostile and toxic. I released a memorandum reforming Presidential staff in order to be more efficient and to simulate real life government by diving the staff into four teams. Advising is very much informal, and I get that. However, I think that a paper trail of what I'm doing goes to the President's plans of government transparency. So, because Mr. Halfcat was acting in such a way, he was fired."

I also of course had to ask why they were acting so formal when we are a mostly informal community. They responded with "The President is the elected leader of the community, and thereby, they have many duties and responsibilities on top of what they do in real life. And as CGP Grey said in his YouTube video called _The Rules for Dictators_, no man rules alone.

My job is to act on behalf of the President in administrative affairs and to assist them in their duties when needed. I reformed staff to be divided in four teams and the President advised me that she wanted to implement the Contacting President Memorandum because she's quite busy in real life, so I did so. The President answers to the People: there is no dispute on that. However, if your going to govern four thousand people and your quite busy as it is without being the President, you are going to need help with your duties. Again, going back to the "no man rules alone" doctrine."

I personally do not believe this fully answered the question at hand however I do believe it offers some insight as to why the job exists and some points brought up are quite interesting.

And of course finally we have what was the Presidents reasoning? I asked why she created the position and why she hired Jacob, she responded with this "Jacob approached me about it and if I would be interested, I said sure as it might just make things a bit easier for me as prez and I did not really see the harm in it. I still think it's a fine enough idea, but it clearly has caused controversy and everything, it's cost me a lot more time than it has saved up to this point let's just say that much."

I also of course asked if she supported Jacobs actions. She said "I think their actions, especially with the whole halfcat\_ thing have been misguided, they come from a different simcommunity with a different 'culture' or whatever. I've now made it clear that things like this will not happen again in the future. I think they have some good ideas, and don't think if a thing is slightly more formal than we are used to it's necessarily bad. Of course I don't want to turn SimDem to MUSGov or anything though lol, that'd be a whole different experience."

I of course do believe that Jont has a point here. Jacob does come from MUSGov and it is only natural for Jacob to act slightly more formal as a result. But one would think that the differences are striking enough that you would know both are not the same.

She has said that "I think Jacob acted rashly and they should have spoken to me before banning anyone, I've now made it clear that nobody shall be banned without my approval and this should not happen again. I've already unbanned halfcat\_ and invited them back to the server."

## Conclusion and my thoughts

And now we come to the best part of the article. My opinions.

It is of my belief that after speaking to everyone that while Jacob is in the wrong, I do not believe it was super serious and I believe it should be forgiven. I was there leading up to the events of Halfs ban. He was saying a lot of shit without giving much reason. However I believe Jacob overreacted and should not have banned without the Presidents approval.

Overall I believe that the interviews were very productive. I of course found out everyone's opinions on the matter and it was very interesting seeing the different viewpoints. I am sure I am not the only one here wishing Jacob a happy rest of his career and let's hope that's the biggest crisis of his time as Presidents Chief of Staff and I wish Jont a very good and successful Presidency.

Thank you all for reading this first edition of Simpolitics. If you have any ideas for future articles or want to be interviewed dm me on discord @SammySnail#6667 or leave a comment on this article.

I hope this has given you all some more insight into this situation.
