Today sees the long-awaited return of the Tau Bot. The Bot allowed citizens to be paid for their governmental work, trade privately or scheme with government officials.

The Tau Bot was removed after failing to reach a two-thirds majority in a public [referendum](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBcx9RhrqPqJW8LJlxRiCJSeWmForki3xEg4lsAEfWQvFd1w/closedform) in regards to keeping the Tau Bot online.

The majority of public citizens were revolting over the decision and asked the next Senate to look into [re-introducing](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/fpwqs9/senate_vote_5_bills_4_resolutions/) the Tau Bot, but with some legal changes to fiscal law.

However, this time, there has been an economic reset. All wealth that was accumulated during the last economic phase will be re-distributed. Many citizens pushed for the reset as a few private citizens amassed great amounts of Tau through private organisations and businesses. This was possible due to the lack of regulation within the Private Sector and also lax laws surrounding how shareholding works.

For this attempt to be successful, the government will need to implement and uphold taxation laws, as well as ensuring the Private Sector fairly distributes income and also follows taxation laws.

Today, the Tau Bot was successfully invited back into Sim-Democracy's Discord Server, allowing citizens to trade amongst themselves again.

Expect a sudden flood of new Organisations and Businesses vying to become market share leaders, expect your DMs to be filled with advertisements and finally expect a brutal battle to become a Sim-Democracy Mogul.

Adding the Tau Bot is another example of Sim-Democracy showing it's intent to go beyond being a Political Simulation, to become a Society Simulator.
