The officially unofficial website of SimDemocracy needs some help. We are looking for content writers to help fill this site with news, reminders, events and more.

We would also like to have help with editing and also basic coding.

If you don't have experience using wordpress, there are many tutorials online and the interface is simple to use. So experience is not a barrier to entry.

To join the team, just DM benitfeet on Discord or Reddit. You can even comment below with your Discord Tag and we will get in touch.
