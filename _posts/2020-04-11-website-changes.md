The website has undegone a few minor tweaks that have, hopefully, enhanced the user experience.

Firstly, getting to the New User Guide and History Book have never been easier. The URLs have changed, stepping away from the sites.google.com format, we now use this domain.

You can now access the New User Guide by simply going to [https://newuserguide.sim-democracy.com](https://newuserguide.sim-democracy.com) , whilst accessing the History Book will be similar with [https://historybook.sim-democracy.com](https://historybook.sim-democracy.com).

Due to the popularity of Minecraft within the SimDemocracy user base, some information has been added to site. This includes how to access the Official Server and more information about what's on the server will come in time.

The methods in which the New User Guide, History Book and Minecraft Server were added to the domain allows us to host websites/servers, related to Sim-Democracy, which don't have a domain. So if you have something you would like to add, email me at benitfeet@sim-democracy.com

The homepage to the site has been cleaned up too, the menu bar has been reorganized with social links been added to the sidebar. This is to help people who discover the site before the subreddit by showing them what they need to know and having the social links in a prominent place.

Finally, I'd like to welcome Mobilfan and Jaguar to the website team, both will be doing different tasks from hosting to blog editing. SammySnail (Imade) will also be joining the team to provide updates on what's happening in the Minecraft Server
