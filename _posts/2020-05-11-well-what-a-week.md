I don't know about you but I'm quite pleased that it's new week. The last 7 days have been a whirlwind that never seemed to end.

Firstly was the Presidential Election, watching it unfold made it feel less than an election but the foundations for the emergence of a dangerous cult. As you may or may not be aware, the field of Presidential Candidates was quite poor. We had a wide variety of questionable characters run, from alleged election riggers, to Gulag supports, to Hagrid. Again, for those who don't know, and unless you lived under a rock last weekend, Hagrid was a user who joined that weekend. They decided to run for President with the following CFC.

This led to huge amounts of messages on Discord and Reddit memes endorsing this candidate. It just shows the low level of quality that ran in the last election.

Well, as we all know, a alleged Election Rigger, Stalin, won the election, which nicely bring me to the next topic of discussion. The unethical firing of Owl as AG. There was a whole host of bullshit reasons as to why Owl was fired from their position. These ranged from the President not being confident in their abilities, to being pushed in a call by several members, to flat out blaming Kjo. The unethical decisions went even further by the President appointing a new AG, who is also allegedly involved in the election rigging and is complicit to those crimes. One begins to wonder what this Presidential term was really about.

This is a massive failure on the President's behalf. The President and their cabinet received heavy criticism for what looks a heavily corrupt move to ensure the election riggers were let off the hook, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/gf3pec/wolfgate_one_month_after_the_crisis_no_trials/) to see their reasoning. This was eventually correct as Interim-AG, Match, dropped all charges against Wolf and their conspires a few days later anyway.

However, it was clouded under the pretence of it being "unfair" on the defence.

The reasoning provided by the interim-AG was that it was unfair to Wolf as the trial had dragged on due to several mistakes by the Department of Justice. The matter should have been closed months ago, as many citizens called for, and the errors of the DoJ lead to unnecessary stress for Wolf.

Was this a move of human decency or does it have undertones of corruption? We will let you decide.

This brings us to the fallout of these decisions. Due to this hot mess of the Speaker, Kjo, being thrown under the bus with no evidence backing the President backing their claims, they have left the server and deleted their Reddit account. This is a major shame and also a cheap way out. If Kjo was innocent, why vanish. If they were guilty of turning the President into a puppet, then they should have faced justice. Just like all the riggers and conspires. It is a shame we will probably never heard from Kjo again. Going further, the drop in charges against Wolf saw the Prosecutor, Kate\_, leave again and the Interim-AG, who is also the Deputy AG and Vice-President will also step down. But one must ask, how can one citizen directly involved in the Presidency be allowed to be a Deputy AG and AG simultaneously.

Well, is that it? No!

Through out the week, several users became vocal hoping that SimDem would hit the chopping block soon. They advocated for the death of the server, not because SimDem has actually become inactive but for personal reasons. These users have a tendency to leave but return within hours or days. Their wishes for death of SimDem is because they lack the personal will-power to stay away and they believe the only way they will be "free" from the "addiction" of SimDem is if SimDem no longer existed. What I say to those people is, get help. SimDemocracy isn't going anywhere anytime soon and if you feel as if you should leave but can't, is that communities fault or your own. These very same users constantly call the Community shit and toxic, but in actuality, those messages and replies are what are toxic and shit. Clear reasoning provided by some SimDem users about the issue at hand led to one of these users leaving, possibly for good.

Now, finally, the Senate election.

What a mess that turned out to be. The first 24 hours went by without a hitch. However, the newly-elected SoE, was unsure about how to calculate the results using the new-ish SPSV calculation method, more on this later. Instead of asking for help from a previous SoE, their deputy or the citizen who wrote SPSV, the, now ex, SoE decided to just give up and leave the server. Leaving the fate of the election hanging in the balance.

With the Deputy SoE taking IRL final exams, the President had to appoint a new SoE mid-way through ballot counting. The person who they presented as their nomination is a very controversial figure when holding positions of power due to previous experience in the server. However, we will not be going into that as that deserves a article of it's own.

Eventually the results were released, you think that's end of it and we can move into the next week with clarity and hope. Wrong.

The results of this Senate election are being disputed by a large number of SimDemocracy citizens, due to how SPSV manipulates the score to make a "fairer" result. Well, that lead to someone who finished 18th overall become elected. The most popular Senators in the past, who ran in this election were all thrown out by this calculation method. Thus, forming, arguablly, one of the most inexperienced, unpopular and weirdest Senate's we have ever seen.

The results really bring the usability of SPSV into question. Is it really more fair and why is it too confusing to understand.

I sincerly hope that the next week will not be another nightmare and that wee all can move on together, stronger.

Until next time.
