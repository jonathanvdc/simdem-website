It's election time once again here in SimDemocracy, as voters head to the polls form to vote for candidates to represent the Senate in SimDem. This election has 29 potential Senators to vote for in the election.

You can check out every candidate's CFC in the Reddit post I link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/fyp1wv/30th_senatorial_election_call_for_candidates/) or in the form.

Don't know how to vote? Well, the SimDemocracy YouTube channel has a quick guide to voting in SimDemocracy here:

I'll update this post as the official voting form releases.

EDIT: The form is [released](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/fzkfv5/30th_simdemocracy_senate_election/)! Go out there and vote!

Happy voting!
