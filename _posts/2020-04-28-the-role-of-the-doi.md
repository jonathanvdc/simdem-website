title: "The Role of the DoI?"

For those who don't work with acronyms, the DoI stands for the Department of Integration. It is ran by the Head of Integration, HoI, whilst it's operations is overlooked by the SoEX, Secretary of Expansion.

First founded during the u/Dovahkiin4e201 Presidential era, the DoI hit the ground running, welcoming new members into the server and becoming a buddy, of sorts, to them. Answering all questions and pointing them in the direction of Department Heads and Branch Heads for potential jobs and roles based upon the new member's interest. They also made regular small guides, such as the Solider Handbook, to help users find their own way around.

Memes were regularly posted on the subreddit, to encourage lurkers to join in and give quick information on how certain things work.

In the past the DoI had, arguably, one of the most important roles within the server, getting new users up to speed with the inner-workings of SimDemocracy. But as time has dragged on, the DoI list of responsibilities has dwindled.

With the creation of the New User Guide, the DoI stopped creating their small guides and instead attempted to shift responsibility of informing lurkers and new users to other areas within SimDemocracy, be it legislated or not. Eventually, the memes stopped too. Occasionally a post appears asking for help on the subreddit, but the DoI doesn't show. Instead, more experienced members take it upon themselves to briefly explain the site and point to the direction of the NUG or Wiki page.

The DoI was unofficially given control over the NUG, as Google Sites settings changes allowed publishing rights. They were tasked with updating information and maintaining the pages to be up-to-date. However, this immediately became neglected. Leaving the NUG unhelpful and misleading.

Whilst on the Discord server, the DoI members stopped welcoming new members all together and left it to members who held the "Welcomer" role. This group of members generally consists of a handful of current and ex DoI members and more experienced members. However, this has led to further frustration as messages have become so repetitive, pointing members to the same information pages, that the Head of Integration requested that a bot takes over the last of the DoI's responsibilities. For a few days this bot messaged new members and it felt no different to the system of Welcomers. The same message reposted several times a day, this eventually lead to the bot removal of the automessage.

#### This has led to the question, what is the future of the DoI?

Whilst that remains unclear, a small task-force headed by President Jont, has been formed to help revive the department. There has been much heated debate in the group about the welcoming role. But one thing is clear, there is a deep divide over the responsibility of welcoming. For now, the current policy has remained, the DoI "officially" welcomes the new members but its left to those with the Welcoming role.

An idea was formed that Wolf and Benitfeet would begin to create videos, with the help of the DoI, on how to do certain things within the community. The foundations of that project will be set imminently.

One suggestion has been to remove the welcoming role and leave the job to the DoI. With the economy back, this responsibility can become attractive to the department members, through a commission based wage.

Another proposal, was to remove the DoI's responsibility of welcoming and leave it to those who would voluntarily welcome new members. This was countered with the fact that even the volunteers don't welcome every new member and even that would need to have some form of motivation boost.

One final proposal was quite extreme, this was to completely remove the DoI as removing welcoming was removing their only responsibility and the department would no longer have a purpose. The New User Guide would be taken back by the Owner and then being updated by a few select people and find funding to pay those users.

Currently, talks are at a standstill. With the Department of Integration's future uncertain, a complete revamp of the DoI is needed to revive it. New ideas by newer members are a must as those members would have integrated during the recent dismal departmental performance. New responsibilities are needed to make the role attractive again. You could say that the creation of the New User Guide triggered the downfall of the DoI. Although it was made with good intent, perhaps it should have never been made at all.
