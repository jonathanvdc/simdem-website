Welcome to SimDemocracy, where citizens can participate in a simulated democracy, passing laws to change its nature.

## Who Are We?

SimDemocracy is an online simulation of a democracy. We began as a Reddit Community aimed at electing our community moderators. We have since evolved into an online society that includes democratically held elections, a judiciary, an economy and much more.

We make use of several online social platforms to simulate this democratic society. You can find all the links in the menu bar and side bar.

It’s extremely important to subscribe on Reddit and join our Discord to take part, these can be found in the side bar.

## How We Began

We began as a very small community on Reddit experimenting to see if a subreddit was capable of holding democratic elections. Founded on February 12th 2019, all of our interactions happened on our subreddit, r/SimDemocracy.

Due to a major scandal, called The Jackie Crisis, we lost our subreddit, forcing us to temporarily move to r/SimRepublic on May 1st 2019 until May 9th 2019. This scandal is what forged Sim-Democracy into what it is today.

It’s knock-on effects, and use of other platforms like Discord, has spawned from a subreddit Democracy Simulator into a Online Society Simulator. To find out more, check out our New User Guide and the History Book in the menu.
